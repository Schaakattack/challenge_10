# Module 10 Challenge - Crypto Clustering
## Project Overview
crypto_investments.ipynb is the main application for this analysis. This project utilizes two unsupervised learning technigues that include
-  K-means
-  K-means using the PCA data

K means is used to group and evaluated elbow plots. 

## Metholodgy
The following steps were taken to complete the data analysis. 
- Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
- Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
- Visualize and Compare the Results


## Code Packages
The following python packages were utilized:

    pandas

    hvPlot - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.

    sklearn.cluster - Clustering algorithm

    sklearn.decomposition - Principal component analysis (PCA)

    sklearn.preprocessing - Standardization, or mean removal and variance scaling
